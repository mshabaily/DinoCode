# DinoCode
DinoCode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tailored for young computer science students aged 12-14. The core concept is to create an educational tool that fosters a comfortable learning environment. Simplified UML class diagrams will aid in understanding object-oriented design principles, aligning with the educational needs of our target users. 

To enhance the user experience, the design incorporates child-friendly backgrounds, making the coding environment visually appealing. Users can also customize themes for a personalised touch. Educational hints and popups offer guidance and encouragement during programming sessions, including reminders to take breaks for healthy learning habits. 

By combining Python development, simplified UML diagrams, child-friendly design, and educational prompts, the IDE aims to provide an engaging and supportive platform for young students to explore computer science and programming.
